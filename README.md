##  Options on Chain



#### Intro

This project uses ERC20 tokens as the basis for designing on-chain options. Each option is an ERC20 token and is priced in eth.
Currently the only option type is ETH call option, players can choose to design their own options (set the strike price, strike time, etc.) and deploy the smart contract. Players can also purchase options issued by others and make their own decisions based on market conditions.
